                                Hello! üë©üèæ‚Äçüíª

                                <br><br>

                                My name is Dara and I'm a Frontend Engineer currently working (remotely) at Helicarrier, a startup focused on building crypto-based solutions for Africans.

                                <br><br>

                                <!-- My experiences have enabled me to develop a solid understanding of the entire web development life cycle - <em>from design to development to deployment</em>. -->

                                I have <em>4+ years</em> of hands-on experience developing websites and web applications across a range of sectors using <em>modern frontend frameworks and tools</em>. I love the work that I do, particularly how various components - layout, typography, colours, imagery, data, language - are merged to <em>create solutions and connect people</em>.

                                <br><br>

                                I'm very passionate about mentoring other women who are keen to get into the tech space. In the past, I have partnered with <a class="img-trigger" href="https://www.blackgirlsintech.org/mentoring-programme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" />
