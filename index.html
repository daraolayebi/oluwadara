                            Hello, thank you for visiting my website! üë©üèæ‚Äçüíª
                            <br><br>As a Frontend Developer, I am driven by the <em>problems I get to solve</em> everyday, and the number of <em>ideas that I am able to explore</em>. I love how various components - layout, typography, colours, imagery,
                            language and data - are merged to <em>bring concepts to life</em>.
                            <br><br> Over the past <em>3 years</em>, I have built web applications using <em>modern frontend frameworks</em> across a range of sectors including finance, retail, charity, transport, and hospitality, to name a few. Through
                            these experiences, I have developed a solid understanding of the core principles of <em>user-centred design for the web</em> and <em>product development</em> - from concept to deployment. Working in the financial space further
                            deepened my knowledge of this as I was constantly building for security and trust, and also learnt how to prioritise ease of use and efficiency.
